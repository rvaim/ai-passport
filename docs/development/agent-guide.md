# AI Agent Development Guide

This guide is for AI coding assistants. `AGENTS.md` is the only mandatory starting document; read this guide for code work and route to hardware or engineering references only when the task requires them.

## Establish context

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and follow its task routing. Do not load every README or the entire hardware guide by default.
2. Run `git status --short --branch` and preserve existing changes.
3. Read affected public headers, implementations, and neighboring code. Do not infer this board's behavior from a generic ESP32-C3 board.
4. Search `origin/demo/*` for a relevant example and reuse only applicable design ideas.
5. Decompose the request into inputs, outputs, state, tasks, persistence, memory budget, and failure behavior before choosing `main` or `components/bsp`.
6. Run focused checks while iterating and `./tools/validate.sh` before delivery. Keep hardware checks explicit.

## Source-of-truth priority

```text
schematic / PCB / board revision / measurement
  > components/bsp/include/bsp_pins.h
  > BSP public headers and implementation
  > docs/hardware-design/AI_HARDWARE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
  > README and demo applications
```

The repository does not currently contain schematic or PCB source. Report unknown revisions, wiring, polarity, registers, and unused GPIO connections; request evidence instead of substituting another board's values.

## Application/BSP boundary

```text
requirement
  └─ main/                         pages, state machines, animation, app tasks, assets
      └─ components/bsp/include/  stable board APIs
          └─ components/bsp/src/  buses, devices, and driver details
              └─ bsp_pins.h       pin and hardware-parameter source of truth
```

New user plug-ins should live under `examples/` or in an external plug-in project and be installed as `.pap`; do not duplicate the system page framework in `main`. Only system apps modify `main`. Reusable platform behavior belongs in `components/passport_core`, `passport_ui`, `passport_link`, or `passport_runtime`.

Normal apps use Passport APIs for page containers, bars, and Link and must not access LVGL, NimBLE, GPIO/I2C, or create FreeRTOS tasks directly. Only hardware behavior shared by multiple system capabilities belongs in `components/bsp`. BSP APIs document blocking behavior, task context, ownership, failures, and initialization order; pins and I2C addresses stay in `bsp_pins.h`.

## Runtime invariants

- Hold `bsp_lvgl_lock()` whenever non-LVGL context accesses LVGL objects.
- Button callbacks dispatch lightweight events only; move audio, storage, networking, and other slow work to worker tasks.
- Stop tasks and timers that may access a page before deleting its screen.
- Preserve menu `UP`/`DOWN`, `OK` click to enter, and page `OK` long-press to return unless the change explicitly redefines them.
- Budget internal RAM for images, fonts, networking, audio, LVGL, and task stacks; this board has no PSRAM.
- Isolate testable state machines, protocols, timing, and layout calculations from ESP-IDF/LVGL and cover them with host tests.

## Delivery

The automated gate is not hardware acceptance. Report `Build`, `Host tests`, `Device tests`, and `Unverified` separately. Use the [hardware guide](../hardware-design/AI_HARDWARE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for the applicable on-device matrix.
