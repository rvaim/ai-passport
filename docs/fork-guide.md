# Fork Workflow

The upstream repository keeps `main` as the current FoloToy baseline. Fork-specific firmware belongs on `feature/*` branches so a fork can continuously synchronize its `main` without mixing product work into the baseline.

## Repository roles

```text
docs/                  product, contribution, development, and design documents
components/bsp/        stable board APIs and hardware implementation
main/                  Passport system launcher, plug-in manager, settings, and themes
assets/                reusable fonts, images, music, and sound effects
skills/                reusable AI-agent skills
tests/                 host-runnable logic tests
sdkconfig.defaults     reproducible ESP32-C3 defaults
```

The root `README.md` path is intentionally available to a fork owner. Upstream's project overview is `docs/README.md`, which GitHub displays when no root README exists. A fork may add its own root README to explain its product without replacing upstream documentation.

## Fork rules

- Keep fork `main` synchronized with `FoloToy/ai-passport:main`.
- On fork `main`, limit fork-owned content to a root `README.md` pair and `docs/assets/`; develop firmware and other changes on `feature/*` branches and merge by pull request.
- Enable GitHub Actions manually after forking. The upstream-sync workflow is disabled by GitHub until the fork owner enables it.
- If development must happen directly on `main`, disable `.github/workflows/sync-main.yml` first to prevent automatic merge conflicts.

Use `docs/assets/` for architecture notes, product design, and images that supplement a fork's README. Upstream keeps that directory empty except for `.gitkeep`; fork-private content must not be proposed back to upstream.

All fork documentation follows the repository language rule: English at the default `.md` path and Simplified Chinese at `.zh_CN.md`, with reciprocal switches.
