# FoloToy AI Passport Hardware Development Guide

This is the board-level context for AI coding assistants and new developers. It records confirmed hardware facts, software architecture, invariants, extension points, and acceptance methods; it does not replace component datasheets.

> Evidence priority: schematic/PCB and measurements > `components/bsp/include/bsp_pins.h` > BSP implementation and this guide > README/demo code. Report conflicts and request the board revision or measurements instead of guessing.

## 1. Before changing hardware-facing code

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, this guide, and the affected BSP header/implementation.
2. Run `git status --short --branch` and preserve unrelated changes.
3. Put reusable hardware behavior in `components/bsp`; keep menu, animation, product interaction, and validation pages in `main`.
4. Keep pins, I2C addresses, and panel dimensions in `bsp_pins.h` only.
5. Mark unknown board revisions, polarity, registers, and wiring as unverified.

## 2. Board overview

The target is the ESP32-C3 FoloToy AI Passport with ESP-IDF 5.5.3. It has 8 MB Flash and no PSRAM; display, audio, radio, tasks, and DMA compete for internal RAM.

| Subsystem | Device or mode | Resource | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MCU | ESP32-C3 | 8 MB Flash | Implemented |
| Display | ST7789P3, 240 × 320, RGB565 | SPI2, 40 MHz, mode 0 | Implemented |
| Backlight | LCD LED | GPIO21, LEDC 5 kHz/10 bit | Implemented |
| Buttons | UP/DOWN/OK resistor ladder | GPIO0 / ADC1_CH0 | Implemented |
| Audio | ES8311 playback and microphone | shared I2C + I2S0 full duplex | Implemented |
| Battery | CW2017 fuel gauge | shared I2C0, address `0x63` | Optional |
| Wi-Fi | 2.4 GHz station | initialized by the demo | Scan demo |
| Bluetooth LE | NimBLE peripheral | initialized by the demo | advertising demo |
| Low power | light/deep sleep | RTC timer wake | 2 s light and 5 s deep sleep demos |
| Console | USB Serial/JTAG | native USB GPIO18/19 | Configured |

The repository does not include schematic, PCB, BOM, battery model, charge-controller details, LCD TE connection, or board revision. Do not claim charging control, USB detection, unverified external wake, display readback, touch, or unused-GPIO availability.

## 3. Pin map

| GPIO | Function | Direction/peripheral | Notes |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | three-button ADC node | ADC1_CH0 input | external 10 kΩ pull-up; boot-related pin |
| 1 | LCD CS | SPI output | ST7789P3 chip select |
| 2 | I2S DOUT | output | MCU to ES8311 |
| 3 | I2S WS | output | MCU is I2S master |
| 4 | I2S DIN | input | ES8311 to MCU |
| 5 | I2S BCLK | output | shared by TX/RX |
| 6 | I2S MCLK | output | required by codec configuration |
| 7 | I2C SCL | bidirectional open drain | ES8311 and CW2017 share I2C0 |
| 8 | LCD SCLK | SPI output | SPI2, 40 MHz, mode 0 |
| 9 | LCD MOSI | SPI output | no MISO; display cannot be read |
| 10 | I2C SDA | bidirectional open drain | internal pull-up enabled; suitable external pull-ups still expected |
| 18/19 | USB Serial/JTAG | USB | reserve for console |
| 20 | LCD DC | output | command/data select |
| 21 | backlight PWM | LEDC output | conflicts with common UART0 default TX |

LCD reset and amplifier enable are `-1`: display reset uses software reset, and the amplifier is treated as always enabled. Confirm the real GPIO and active level before changing these values. A GPIO absent from this table is not automatically free.

## 4. Architecture and lifecycle

```text
app_main
  ├─ shared I2C init and scan
  ├─ display and LVGL init, then persisted/default backlight
  ├─ button init
  ├─ audio init
  ├─ battery init
  └─ Passport system launcher, plug-in manager, settings, and themes
```

Display/LVGL is a hard dependency. Buttons, audio, and battery are soft dependencies whose pages show `[FAIL]` while other pages remain available. Public BSP APIs are under `components/bsp/include/`; most initialization is idempotent, but there is no universal BSP deinitialization API.

NimBLE still uses ESP-IDF rather than the BSP, but `components/passport_link` now owns it as a system service. Normal plug-ins do not access GATT/NimBLE directly. V1 deliberately keeps only Peripheral/Broadcaster with one connection to limit RAM on the ESP32-C3 without PSRAM; active Central/Observer discovery is deferred. Wi-Fi and light/deep sleep are not exposed as Passport Platform v1 system APIs.

## 5. Display and LVGL

- Panel: ST7789P3, 240 × 320 portrait, RGB565, SPI2 MOSI-only at 40 MHz, mode 0.
- `BSP_LCD_INVERT_COLOR=1`; change inversion only after measurement with the replacement panel.
- Reset is software-only, gap is `(0, 0)`, X/Y mirroring is disabled, and LVGL rotation may override lower-level mirror settings.
- The vendor porch, power, and gamma sequence in `bsp_display.c` is panel-specific. Do not treat it as a universal ST7789 sequence.
- `swap_bytes=true` is required because LVGL emits little-endian RGB565 while SPI sends the high byte first.

The LVGL DMA buffer is one `240 × 20` RGB565 buffer, about 9.6 KB; the LVGL internal pool is 24 KB. Do not add large/double buffers without checking internal RAM, the largest contiguous heap block, and I2S DMA.

The system applies the persisted display brightness immediately after LVGL initialization. A fresh or invalid settings snapshot defaults to 50%; supported levels are 10% through 100% in 10% steps. Automatic screen-off sets the backlight to 0 without entering light/deep sleep.

LVGL is not thread-safe. Timer callbacks in LVGL context may access objects directly. Button callbacks and worker tasks must use `bsp_lvgl_lock()`/`bsp_lvgl_unlock()`. Stop producers before deleting a page and clear static object pointers afterward.

## 6. ADC button ladder

GPIO0 has an external 10 kΩ pull-up to 3.3 V. UP, DOWN, and OK connect it to ground through 0 Ω, 1 kΩ, and 2.2 kΩ respectively.

| State | Nominal voltage | Current window |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| UP | about 0 mV | `[0, 150)` mV |
| DOWN | about 300 mV | `[150, 447)` mV |
| OK | about 595 mV | `[447, 1900)` mV |
| Released | about 3300 mV | outside all windows |

Do not replace the external resistor with the inaccurate internal pull-up. The BSP creates one ADC1 oneshot unit and shares it with all button devices and voltage reads. Attenuation is `ADC_ATTEN_DB_12`. Callbacks originate in the button component task and must not block or perform heavy UI work.

Calibrate thresholds using multiple boards, charge levels, and reasonable temperatures; leave margin between measured distributions rather than relying only on divider theory.

## 7. Shared I2C

I2C0 uses SDA GPIO10 and SCL GPIO7. ES8311 is 7-bit address `0x18`; CW2017 is `0x63`. `bsp_i2c.c` exclusively owns the bus.

- Never create a second temporary bus on the same port for probing or a device.
- Scan with `i2c_master_probe()` on the existing bus. The scan covers `0x08` through `0x77`; success means the scan completed, not that a device was found.
- CW2017 runs at 100 kHz. ES8311 control is managed by `esp_codec_dev`.
- The codec control API expects an 8-bit address, so ES8311 receives `0x18 << 1`; do not copy that shift into 7-bit ESP-IDF APIs.

Troubleshoot in order: bus-init log, scan results for `0x18`/`0x63`, power/ground/wiring/pull-ups, address format, and accidental duplicate-bus creation.

## 8. ES8311 audio

The MCU is I2S master and the ES8311 is slave. I2S0 TX/RX shares MCLK GPIO6, BCLK GPIO5, and WS GPIO3; DOUT is GPIO2 and DIN is GPIO4. The demo opens 16 kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM over a physically two-slot standard-I2S bus.

- Call `bsp_audio_set_format()` before PCM I/O.
- A format change must close and reopen `esp_codec_dev`; an already open device is not reconfigured.
- Preserve the I2S enable/disable sequence around close/open.
- Do not write ES8311 clock-divider registers after open; the driver derives them from sample rate and 256×fs MCLK.
- Keep `no_dac_ref=true` for mono microphone input; false can produce all-zero capture.
- Microphone analog gain is 30 dB; output volume is a separate 0–100% value.
- `bsp_audio_read/write` block and must not run in button callbacks or the LVGL task.
- I2S DMA uses six descriptors of 240 frames each.

System volume is persisted separately from microphone gain and defaults to 30%. Key sound defaults off. The settings service queues volume previews and key feedback to its worker, which lazily initializes the codec; no blocking codec operation runs in a button callback or the LVGL task.

The audio demo's three-second recording buffer is about 96 KB and is the largest transient heap allocation. Prefer chunked streaming for longer audio. Production task shutdown needs a cancellable loop and explicit exit handshake rather than deleting a task blocked in codec I/O.

## 9. CW2017 fuel gauge

Initialization reads VERSION, writes CONFIG `0x00`, waits 100 ms, and uses the chip's built-in Li-Poly profile. The repository intentionally does not write a custom cell profile.

- SOC uses registers `0x04–0x05`; values above 100 are treated as not ready and return `-1`.
- Voltage uses the 14-bit value at `0x02–0x03`, converted as `raw × 312.5 µV`, and returned in mV.
- Transactions use a 100 ms timeout at 100 kHz.
- A missing device returns `ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND`; the battery page is disabled without stopping the application.

Accurate production SOC requires the cell parameters, CW2017 datasheet/vendor profile, and full charge/discharge validation.

## 10. Flash, console, and memory

All AI Passport hardware revisions use 8 MB Flash. `sdkconfig.defaults` fixes the image to 8 MB and disables automatic flash-size header rewriting. The current `partitions.csv` keeps 24 KB NVS, 4 KB PHY data, a 3 MB factory application, and uses the remaining ~4.94 MiB as a wear-levelled FAT `appfs` for plug-ins, themes, and staging. V1 has no OTA slot. A detected non-8-MB device is a hardware/material/connection anomaly to investigate, not a reason to lower the project default.

The console is USB Serial/JTAG. Do not switch to the UART0 default output without resolving its GPIO21 conflict with the backlight.

Review at least the 24 KB LVGL pool, 9.6 KB LCD DMA buffer, the settings worker's 3 KiB stack, lazy I2S DMA, 96 KB demo recording, radio stacks, task stacks, total free heap, and largest contiguous block when adding assets, TLS/networking, audio buffers, or double buffering.

## 11. Adding features

For reusable hardware capability, add `bsp_<feature>.h` and its implementation, keep constants in `bsp_pins.h`, update component CMake/dependencies, return `esp_err_t`, log actionable pin/address context, and document threading, blocking, ownership, initialization, and failure behavior.

Only system apps should modify `main`; normal user plug-ins use Passport UI and are installed as `.pap`. Reusable platform behavior belongs in `passport_core`, `passport_ui`, `passport_link`, or `passport_runtime`, while board-level hardware remains in the BSP. Stop every UI producer before destroying a page, keep device-visible copy in Simplified Chinese with the shared 14 px / 4 bpp system font, move slow work to workers, lock LVGL outside its task, and preserve the system-level OK-long-press return behavior.

## 12. Development environment

Use ESP-IDF 5.5.3 outside the repository. On Ubuntu/Debian, install the standard ESP-IDF prerequisites, clone Espressif's `v5.5.3` tag recursively, and run `./install.sh esp32c3`. Activate its `export.sh` in every terminal and confirm `idf.py --version`.

```bash
get_idf553
idf.py set-target esp32c3
idf.py reconfigure
idf.py build
```

The Component Manager resolves dependencies from `components/bsp/idf_component.yml`. Do not edit `managed_components/`. `dependencies.lock` is tracked and must remain reproducible under ESP-IDF 5.5.3. Generated `sdkconfig` does not automatically absorb every changed default; inspect it and use `idf.py fullclean` only for stale generated state.

Flash through the native USB Serial/JTAG port, commonly `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux:

```bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor
```

The actual port may differ. Check the cable, enumeration, permissions, power, and download mode before changing USB GPIOs or console configuration. Avoid running `idf.py` permanently as root.

## 13. Build and device validation

Run `./tools/validate.sh` for the complete automated gate. A successful build is the minimum automated result, not physical-device acceptance.

General board acceptance:

- Stable USB Serial/JTAG logs without reboot loops, assertions, watchdogs, or persistent errors.
- I2C scan sees ES8311 at `0x18` and, when fitted, CW2017 at `0x63`.
- UP/DOWN wraps menu navigation, OK click enters, and OK long press returns.
- An optional peripheral failure disables only its page.
- Repeated navigation and operation do not leak heap, tasks, timers, or objects.

| Change | Required physical observations |
| --- | --- |
| Pin/I2C | scan, all shared devices, boot straps, USB logs |
| LCD | color blocks, orientation, clipping, inversion, byte order, backlight levels |
| ADC/buttons | released and pressed mV, click/double/long events, margin across battery levels |
| Settings | 50% first boot, 10% brightness steps, 30% volume preview, 30 s screen-off, consumed wake press, key-sound toggle, and reboot persistence |
| Codec/I2S | 1 kHz tone, non-zero recording, correct playback speed, format changes, page exit |
| Battery | plausible SOC/mV, graceful missing-device behavior, intermittent-I2C recovery |
| Wi-Fi | visible scan count/SSID/RSSI, rescan, repeated entry/exit |
| Bluetooth LE | phone sees `FoloPassport`, restart advertising, advertising stops on exit, repeated entry/exit |
| Light/deep sleep | select with UP/DOWN; 2 s light sleep resumes with backlight; 5 s deep sleep restarts with timer cause and retained count |
| DMA/memory/UI | build memory report, runtime minimum heap/largest block, stable concurrent audio/display |

## 14. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check first |
| --- | --- |
| Backlight but no image | CS/DC/MOSI/SCLK, vendor sequence, software reset, display-on, SPI mode |
| Wrong colors | byte swap, RGB/BGR, inversion; change one variable at a time |
| Rotation change has no effect | LVGL rotation overriding lower-level mirror |
| Backlight or console failure | GPIO21 conflict with UART0 default TX |
| Screen never turns off or a wake key activates UI | persisted timeout value, activity timestamp, 250 ms worker check, and wake-sequence suppression |
| Button confusion | external 10 kΩ pull-up, measured voltage, thresholds, attenuation |
| `adc1 is already in use` | accidental second ADC1 oneshot unit |
| Both I2C devices disappear | accidental second I2C0 bus |
| Only ES8311 missing | address API shift and codec power |
| Audio speed/pitch wrong | close/open on format change, sample rate/MCLK, no manual clock writes |
| Key sound or volume preview is silent | key-sound setting, persisted volume, ES8311/I2S lazy-init log, and worker availability |
| Recording is zero | `no_dac_ref`, DIN GPIO4, microphone path, gain |
| Recording allocation fails | no PSRAM; shorten/stream and inspect largest block |
| Battery shows `--` | `0x63` response, invalid SOC, profile/startup delay |
| Wi-Fi/BLE fails on second entry | stack stop/deinit and one-time NVS/event-loop setup |
| Black after light sleep | timer wake source, sleep error, backlight restore |
| Deep sleep does not restart | timer source, boot wake cause, RTC counter |
| I2S allocation fails after UI growth | competition among LCD/LVGL buffers and I2S DMA |

## 15. Pre-delivery checklist

- [ ] No duplicated pins, addresses, dimensions, or board parameters.
- [ ] No unsupported capability presented as confirmed fact.
- [ ] No second I2C0 bus or ADC1 unit.
- [ ] Non-LVGL contexts lock LVGL access.
- [ ] Blocking hardware work stays out of button callbacks and the LVGL task.
- [ ] Page exit prevents background access to deleted objects.
- [ ] Audio format changes retain close/open and required codec settings.
- [ ] Memory review includes LVGL, LCD DMA, I2S DMA, task stacks, and largest block.
- [ ] Automated validation passed or the actual failure is reported.
- [ ] Hardware checks remain listed as unverified until observed.
- [ ] The diff contains only task-scoped changes and preserves user work.

## 16. Missing production evidence

A production hardware specification still requires board revision and schematic, PCB/BOM, complete LCD module identification and sequence source, battery model/capacity, CW2017 profile, charge and power path, speaker/microphone and amplifier details, external I2C pull-up values, power-domain/current limits, unused-GPIO connectivity, and temperature/voltage/EMC results.

Until those are available, development is limited to capabilities covered by the existing BSP and timer-based light/deep sleep. External wake, board power figures, charging, unused-pin reuse, audio power, and battery accuracy require hardware evidence first.
